            <h4>About the teacher<img id="im_vero" src="img/vero/vero.jpg" alt="mi_pic" /></h4>
            <p>Hi! I am Veronica and I come from Buenos Aires, Argentina. For more than 6 years now I have been working - with passion and joy - as a Spanish teacher.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>My education as a Spanish teacher began with a Bachelor's Degree in Language Arts at the University of Buenos Aires, from which I have graduated with honors. Then, I received a scholarship for a Master's Program called &#34;Learning and Teaching Spanish in Multilingual and International Contexts&#34;. Thanks to it I have lived and studied in Spain, the U.S.A. and the Netherlands. I also took the course &#34;Initial Training for Teachers of Spanish as a Foreign Language&#34; (Cervantes Institute) and attended to several conferences and workshops related to Spanish teaching and learning.</p>
            <br />
            <p>In the year 2007 I started working as a teacher. Since then I have met students of different origins, ages, levels and interests. Besides having a deep knowledge about the published books for learning Spanish, I have also prepared educational materials specially destined to my students' needs. </p>
            <br />
            <p>My students say that I am a cheerful, patient and vocational teacher. </p>
            <br />
            <p><a #contacto>I hope to meet you soon!</a></p>

            <h2>Your Spanish course</h2>
            <h4>About the approach and methodology</h4>
            <br />
            <p>All my lessons are based in the communicative approach. In this globalized and interconnected world, communication is a key feature for the future. Therefore, in my courses you will be active and using Spanish to express yourself from the first day.</p>
            <br />
            <p>If you want to know a language it is also important to learn about the community that speaks it. Those details about everyday life, music, movies and ways of communicating are the ones that make a language lesson a true experience of cultural exchange. In class we will use authentic and current materials from different Spanish-speaking countries and of different formats: songs, videos, news, blogs, photographs, etc.</p>
            <br />
            <p>My philosophy as a teacher is that each student is unique: he/she has his/her own interests, needs and learning style. That is why it is essential for me to get to know my students and design a specific course according to their objectives. </p>
